L4S FreeBSD Source:
---------------
This repository contains the source code for the FreeBSD kernel modified to support Low Latency, Low Loss, Scalable throughput (L4S) architecture in the 'ipfw' module as a separate AQM scheduler scheme.
L4S aims to provide a solution for reducing latency and packet loss while maintaining scalable throughput, making it ideal for real-time applications such as video conferencing, online gaming, and other interactive services.
